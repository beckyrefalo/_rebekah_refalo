        <p>Valletta to Host First-Ever "Midnight Parliament" in Bid to Boost Youth Engagement
VALLETTA – In an unprecedented move, the Maltese government has announced the launch of “Midnight Parliament,” a late-night legislative session aimed at involving university students and young professionals in live political debate.

Prime Minister Leanne Mifsud said the initiative will begin as a trial in September, with debates livestreamed on national TV. Critics argue it’s a populist stunt, while supporters hail it as “a bold experiment in democratic accessibility.”

“We need to meet citizens where they are — even if that’s at midnight,” Mifsud said.</p>

Valletta – July 29, 2025</h5>
        <p>
The government has announced a one-time rebate on energy bills for households and small businesses as the country continues to face extreme heat. With temperatures soaring past 38°C for the fourth consecutive week, Energy Minister Miriam Dalli said the measure is aimed at easing the financial burden of increased electricity usage due to fans and air conditioning.

"People are rightly concerned about their utility bills as they try to stay cool. This rebate will be automatically deducted from the August bill and will not require any application process," Dalli said during a press briefing.

The rebate will range between €30 and €60 depending on the size of the household or business consumption. NGOs welcomed the measure but called for longer-term strategies to address energy poverty, especially for vulnerable groups like the elderly and low-income families.

The Meteorological Office has issued further warnings for high temperatures this week, urging the public to stay hydrated and avoid prolonged exposure to the sun.

        <p>Malta International Airport Reports Record Summer Traffic
Luqa – July 29, 2025

Malta International Airport (MIA) has recorded its busiest July in history, handling over 980,000 passengers—a 9% increase over the same period last year. Airport officials attributed the surge to strong travel demand from European markets, particularly Germany, Italy, and the United Kingdom.

MIA CEO Alan Borg said the figures reflect “a robust rebound in tourism and air travel confidence,” following several years of pandemic-related uncertainty. He noted that new routes and increased flight frequency played a key role in achieving the milestone.

Tourism Minister Clayton Bartolo welcomed the news, describing it as a sign of confidence in Malta’s hospitality sector. However, some tourism operators expressed concern over the island’s infrastructure capacity to handle the growing numbers.

Calls for improved transport options, better signage, and streamlined airport services have been growing, particularly from Gozo-based tour operators. The government is expected to publish its updated national tourism strategy later this year.</p>

        <p>Year-Round School Calendar Proposal Opens for Public Consultation
Valletta – July 29, 2025

The Ministry for Education has opened a public consultation on a proposed shift to a year-round academic calendar, potentially replacing Malta’s traditional long summer break with shorter, more frequent holidays throughout the year.

The proposed change, which could come into effect in 2026, would see summer holidays reduced to six weeks, with additional mid-term breaks and longer Easter and Christmas recesses. Education Minister Clifton Grima said the reform is being considered to support better learning outcomes, reduce student burnout, and ease child care burdens for working parents.

“We want to align our system with modern educational practices while ensuring we maintain our cultural rhythm and family traditions,” Grima said. The ministry is collecting feedback from parents, educators, and students through an online portal open until September.

While some educators and psychologists praised the move for supporting student wellbeing and reducing ‘learning loss,’ teachers' unions warned of potential disruptions to staff contracts and extracurricular programming. The Malta Union of Teachers said it supports consultation but expects clarity on working conditions and resources.</p>

        <p>PN Demands Full Disclosure of Delimara Energy Deal
Valletta – July 29, 2025

The Nationalist Party has renewed its call for full transparency regarding the 2023 Delimara power station energy deal, raising questions about pricing terms, environmental impact, and procurement procedures. During a press conference outside Castille, Opposition leader Bernard Grech urged the government to publish all related contracts and technical assessments.

Grech claimed the agreement, reportedly involving a 10-year fuel supply arrangement with a foreign provider, could burden taxpayers and tie Malta to outdated energy infrastructure. “This is not just about costs—this is about Malta’s energy future and public trust,” he said.

The deal was signed last year to secure stable LNG supply for the Delimara plant, amid global price volatility. While the government insists the contract is competitive and compliant with EU regulations, critics argue that cleaner energy sources were sidelined.

Environmentalist groups have also echoed concerns, questioning the long-term ecological implications. The Energy Ministry has declined to publish the full agreement, citing commercial sensitivity, but said a redacted summary will be presented to Parliament in the coming weeks.</p>

        <p>National Lottery Numbers Accidentally Predicted in Local Play, Causes Public Frenzy
          MOSTA – Chaos erupted at a local theatre on Saturday after it emerged that a fictional lottery number drawn during the second act of the satirical play Il-Milied tal-Maħfra matched all six numbers of that evening’s actual national lottery draw.

The theatre group claims it was pure coincidence, but social media users have dubbed the playwright “the Nostradamus of Mosta.”

The incident has drawn crowds to the theatre and a small police investigation into betting irregularities — no wrongdoing has been found.

        <p>Rare Albino Blue Rock Thrush Spotted in Dingli Cliffs, Birdwatchers Rejoice
DINGLI – A rare albino Merill (Blue Rock Thrush), Malta’s national bird, was sighted on Dingli Cliffs this morning by a group of amateur birdwatchers.

Ornithologists confirm it is the first albino specimen recorded on the island. BirdLife Malta has cordoned off the area and urged photographers to keep their distance.

“This is like seeing a unicorn,” said avian biologist Dr. Lara Schembri.</p>
